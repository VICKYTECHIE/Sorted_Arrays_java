# Sorted_Arrays_java
This repository contains Java code for two common sorting algorithms: bubble sort and selection sort. These algorithms are both simple and efficient, making them good candidates for learning about sorting algorithms.
Bubble Sort :

Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. 
The algorithm is named because it bubbles the largest elements to the top of the list.
Selection Sort :

Selection sort is another simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly selecting the smallest element from ,
the unsorted part of the list and placing it in its correct position in the sorted part of the list.
